This should eventually become rocket-etl documentation.


The whole Marshmallow schema thing is very weird and has to be handled carefully.

If you have a CSV file with a particular field name (like "OTP_Pct") and you want to change the
field name in the output (to "on_time_percent"), you can do it like this:

class OnTimePerformanceSchema(pl.BaseSchema):
    on_time_percent = fields.Float(load_from="otp_pct", allow_none=True)

I think you could also do it like this:

class OnTimePerformanceSchema(pl.BaseSchema):
     otp_pct = fields.Float(dump_to="on_time_percent", allow_none=True)


If you've got a pre_load transformation, when you are trying to address this field,
you have to use the auto-lowercased version of the field name:

    @pre_load
    def fix_nas(self, data):
        for k, v in data.items():
            if k in ['otp_pct']:
                if v in ['NA']:
                    data[k] = None
